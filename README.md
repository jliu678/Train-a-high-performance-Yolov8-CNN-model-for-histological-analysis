# High-Performance Medical Object Detection via YOLOv8 Trained by Data Augmentation and Active Learning
I engineered a high-performance histological analysis tool using YOLOv8, optimizing model accuracy through data augmentation and implementing Active Learning to combat overfitting and streamline the labeling process. Briefly,
- I used a sliding window approach for data augmentation to handle high-resolution images or small objects
- Initially trained YOLOV8 model shows overfitting (high variance): high performance on training data but low performance on testing data
- I performed Active Learning by focusing on the “weakest” labels and adding more targeted data
- I eventually, obtained a high-performance model

The github and blog will be composed soon, but let us preview the beautiful predictions made by our trained model-- **it shows even higher robustness than human labels**
